# Movie/Series Sorter

## Task 1:
My application will be used by people looking to compare series and movies which they have both seen or like in order to see a match for what they could watch together. The application itself will take a list of series/ movies input by the users adn will compare the two lists to see which series match. It would also sort through them since the user could add the genre and then display all series of x genre if there are no matches. This project is of interest for me since I do struggle finding things to watch when I'm with people and we end up not being able to decide what to watch. This would simplify that process.


##**User Stories:**
- As a user, I want to be able to add series to a list
- As a user, I want to be able to remove series from a list
- As a user, I want to be able to add movie to a list

I would not do any refactoring as this is as clean as my tree can get with the different types of media that I have
